🧠 Key Concepts
✅ Modular Controllers
Frontend/ – User-facing routes: homepage, articles, categories, search, video, podcast, live.

Admin/ – Dashboard to manage content.

Api/ – For RSS feeds, mobile apps, personalization.

✅ Services
App\Services\MediaService.php – Uploading, thumbnail generation, transcoding.

App\Services\RecommendationService.php – Suggest articles.

App\Services\LiveUpdateService.php – WebSocket/polling logic for real-time coverage.

✅ Middleware Ideas
CacheResponse – Cache key pages (homepage, categories).

TrackUserActivity – For personalization data.

CheckAdmin – CMS access control.

✅ CMS Dashboard
Admin routes can be protected via middleware and rendered using admin.blade.php layout, with modules for:

Add/Edit Articles

Manage Media

Publish Schedules

Embed YouTube/Audio links

View Metrics (basic analytics)

💾 Database Model Highlights
Model	Relationship
Article	belongsTo Category, hasMany Media
Category	hasMany Articles
User	(for personalization & authors)
Media	morphTo (Article, Podcast, Video)
Podcast	hasMany Episodes
LiveUpdate	belongsTo Event
